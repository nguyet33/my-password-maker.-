## Description:
THe goal of this project is to create an appolication that will generate a strong password for users based upon the desirable requirement. Here I learn how to call function and build on top of code that was given to me. I was able to learn how to declare variables, create prompts for users input, then take those input and confirm with my checkpoint to then create a new desirable password. I learn how to use a for loop to create a randomization to my application. Ontop of that, I learned to to concat the user's choices to the variable that was declared previously. 

## Installation:
- Download and clone my repo through Github via https://github.com/nguyet33/my-password-maker.-
-OR you can launch the live application at : https://nguyet33.github.io/my-password-maker.-/ 

## Usage:
Step 1: Open the application 
Step 2: Click on generate password
